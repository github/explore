I'm suggesting these edits to an existing topic or collection:

Please explain why these changes are necessary:


************CURATING A NEW TOPIC************

- [ ] I've formatted my changes as a new folder directory, named for the topic as it appears in the URL on GitHub (e.g. `https://github.com/topics/[NAME]`)
- [ ] My folder contains a `*.png` image (if applicable) and `index.md`
- [ ] All required fields in my `index.md` conform to the Style Guide and API docs: https://github.com/github/explore/tree/master/docs

Please explain why you think this topic should be curated:
