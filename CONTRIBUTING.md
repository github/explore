# Contributing

Hi there! We're excited you have ideas to improve topics and collections. You're helping the community discover valuable information.

This project adheres to the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

There are a few ways you can contribute:

- Improving an existing topic or collection
- Curating a new topic or collection

As you write content, check out the [Style Guide](./docs/styleguide.md) to learn what each field means, and how it should be formatted. Following the style guide will increase the chances of your contribution being accepted.

Notes:

- Updates won't immediately appear once we've merged your PR. We pull in these changes regularly to GitHub.
- Please limit your pull request to the creation/updating of one topic or collection at a time.

## Improving an existing topic or collection

If a topic or collection already exists, it will be listed in its respective directory:

- [topics/](https://github.com/github/explore/tree/main/topics)
- [collections/](https://github.com/github/explore/tree/main/collections)

The topic or collection name should match its URL, e.g. `https://github.com/topics/rails` corresponds to the [`topics/rails` directory](https://github.com/github/explore/tree/main/topics/rails).

To make an improvement, please **open a pull request** with your proposed changes. 

### Update the image

To update the image, simply replace the image inside the directory for the topic or collection.

### Update text and links

To update text and links, edit the `index.md` inside the topic or collection's directory. These files are formatted using a combination of [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) and simple body content.

For **topics**, you'll notice that, in examples like the topic "[algorithm](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/main/topics/algorithm/index.md)," data like its canonical URL, Wikipedia URL, or display name are called out in key-value pairs, while its detailed description is accounted for in the body of the document.

_/topics/algorithm/index.md_:

```markdown
---
aliases: algorithms
display_name: Algorithm
short_description: Algorithms are self-contained sequences that carry out a variety of tasks.
topic: algorithm
wikipedia_url: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm
---
Algorithms are detailed sets of guidelines created for a computer program to complete tasks efficiently and thoroughly.
```

---

Similarly, **collections** like "[music](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/main/collections/music/index.md)" call out things like their author and display name in Front Matter variables -- with a detailed description in the body of the document. Most importantly, though, collections identify their individual collection items in [a YAML list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML#Basic_components) for the key "items."

**Please fill out the pull request template completely,** if you do not fill out the template, your PR will be closed.

## Curating a new topic or collection

If a topic or collection is not yet curated, it will NOT be listed in its respective directory.

We are likely to consider suggestions to curate a topic or collection that is valuable to GitHub's community. Valuable topics, for example, include those that are already [widely used by repositories](https://help.github.com/articles/classifying-your-repository-with-topics/) and could benefit from the addition of important information. When suggesting content, please consider how to make your contribution broadly useful and relevant to others, rather than serving a specific use case.

Please note that all suggestions must adhere to GitHub's [Community Guidelines](https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/) and [Terms of Service](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/). Per our Terms of Service, [you are responsible](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#d-user-generated-content) for the content you contribute, and you must have the rights to use it.

To propose a new topic or collection, please **open a pull request** with your proposed additions. The [API docs](./docs/API.md) and [style guide](./docs/styleguide.md) provide guidance on the information you need to include and how it should be formatted.

This repository includes [a list of the most-used GitHub topics that don't yet have extra context](topics-todo.md). If your pull request adds one of these topics, please update topics-todo.md so that the topic is checked (marked complete).

**Please fill out the pull request template completely.** If you do not fill out the template, your pull request will be closed.

## Guidelines

- Avoid conflicts of interest. These should be of general community interest, not a marketing vehicle for a product or a personal project. If you are a direct employee of a company creating the project, or the creator and sole maintainer, it's unlikely to be accepted.
- We love experimenting with new technologies, and we are especially fond of GitHub Copilot. But as with all new technology, many of us are still getting accustomed to using generative AI tools effectively. Here are important guidelines to follow when using generative AI to contribute to this repository (adapted from the [GitHub Community Discussions CoC](https://github.com/community/community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#reasonable-use-of-ai-generated-content)):
  - Read and revise the content before you post it. Use your own authentic voice and edit.
  - Do not post AI-generated content verbatim to pad out the size and number of your contributions. Your changes should materially improve the site, not just say the same thing in different words.
  - AI tools will often provide completely inaccurate or invented answers to prompts. Verify with an independent source that the information is correct before including it.

## Running tests

There are some lint tests in place to ensure each topic is formatted in the way we expect. GitHub
Actions will run the tests automatically. If you want to run the tests # Contributing

# Introduction to GitHub

_Get started using GitHub in less than an hour._

</header>

## Welcome

People use GitHub to build some of the most advanced technologies in the world. Whether you’re visualizing data or building a new game, there’s a whole community and set of tools on GitHub that can help you do it even better. GitHub Skills’ “Introduction to GitHub” course guides you through everything you need to start contributing in less than an hour.

- **Who is this for**: New developers, new GitHub users, and students.
- **What you'll learn**: We'll introduce repositories, branches, commits, and pull requests.
- **What you'll build**: We'll make a short Markdown file you can use as your [profile README](https://docs.github.com/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/managing-your-profile-readme).
- **Prerequisites**: None. This course is a great introduction for your first day on GitHub.
- **How long**: This course takes less than one hour to complete.

In this course, you will:

1. Create a branch
2. Commit a file
3. Open a pull request
4. Merge your pull request

### How to start this course

[![start-course](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1221423/235727646-4a590299-ffe5-480d-8cd5-8194ea184546.svg)](https://github.com/new?template_owner=skills&template_name=introduction-to-github&owner=%40me&name=skills-introduction-to-github&description=My+clone+repository&visibility=public)

1. Right-click **Start course** and open the link in a new tab.
2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repository, as private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).
   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the new repository's README.

### Example of Add Check Bot for Project Maintainers

#### Bot Logic:
```python
import discord
from discord.ext import commands

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!')

maintainers = {
    "Teachmastermindpat": {"project": "AfricaCryptoChainx", "sponsorship": 100},
    "maintainerUsername1": {"project": "AfricaCryptoChainx ABC", "sponsorship": 100},
    "maintainerUsername2": {"project": "AfricaCryptoChainx DEF", "sponsorship": 100}
}

@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f'Logged in as {bot.user}')

@bot.command()
async def add_maintainer(ctx, username, project, sponsorship):
    if username in maintainers:
        await ctx.send(f'{username} already exists in the list.')
    else:
        maintainers[username] = {"project": project, "sponsorship": sponsorship}
        await ctx.send(f'{username} added successfully with project {project} and sponsorship {sponsorship}.')

bot.run('YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN')
```

### Project Information:
The **AfricaCryptoChainx-Ccxt-wallet** feature integrates within the app, using free tools and bots for secure, real-time cryptocurrency transactions. Powered by open-source technology, it supports financial inclusion and blockchain transparency. Learn more at [AfricaCryptoChainx](https://africacryptochainx.com).

### Utilizing GitHub Actions, CodeQL, and Python

#### GitHub Actions Workflow:
Create a GitHub Actions workflow to automate your project tasks.

```yaml
name: AfricaCryptoChainx Workflow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.x'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run tests
        run: python -m unittest discover
```

#### CodeQL Analysis:
Add CodeQL to analyze your code for vulnerabilities.

```yaml
name: CodeQL

on:

1. **Create Workflow File:**
   - Create a new directory in your repository called `.github/workflows`.
   - Create a file named `wallet-transaction.yml`.

2. **Define the Workflow:**
   - Add the following content to the `wallet-transaction.yml` file:

```yaml
name: Wallet Transaction Workflow

on:
  issues:
    types: [opened, edited]
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  filter:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Filter by Keyword
      if: contains(github.event.issue.title, 'AfricaCryptoChainx') || contains(github.event.issue.body, 'AfricaCryptoChainx') || contains(github.event.issue.body, 'CCXT Wallet')
      run: echo "Relevant keyword found in issue"

    - name: Filter by File
      if: ${{ github.event.pull_request }}
      run: |
        FILES=$(git diff --name-only ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha }} ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }})
        echo "$FILES" | grep 'transactions/' && echo "Transaction file changed" || echo "No relevant file changes"
```

### Probot Bot Code for Wallet Transactions

1. **Write Your Bot Code:**
   - Create a JavaScript file for your bot, for example, `index.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = (app) => {
  app.on(['issues.opened', 'issues.edited'], async (context) => {
    const issueContent = context.payload.issue.body;
    if (issueContent.includes('AfricaCryptoChainx') || issueContent.includes('CCXT Wallet')) {
      const issueComment = context.issue({ body: 'Keyword related to AfricaCryptoChainx-CCXT wallet transaction found in issue' });
      await context.octokit.issues.createComment(issueComment);
    }
  });

  app.on(['pull_request.opened', 'pull_request.synchronize'], async (context) => {
    const filesChanged = await context.octokit.pulls.listFiles(context.repo({
      pull_number: context.payload.pull_request.number
    }));
    
    if (filesChanged.data.some(file => file.filename.includes('transactions/'))) {
      const prComment = context.issue({ body: 'Relevant transaction file changed in pull request' });
      await context.octokit.issues.createComment(prComment);
    }
  });
};
```

### Using Your Project Information

1. **Update the Workflow File:**
   - Ensure that the keyword filtering includes relevant terms like 'AfricaCryptoChainx' and 'CCXT Wallet'.
   - Replace `'transactions/'` with the specific directory or file path relevant to your wallet transaction files.

2. **Deploy the Probot Bot:**
   - Set up and deploy your Probot bot with the provided `index.js` file to a hosting platform like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

### Probot Bot Code for Wallet Transactions

1. **Write Your Bot Code:**
   - Create a JavaScript file for your bot, for example, `index.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = (app) => {
  app.on(['issues.opened', 'issues.edited'], async (context) => {
    const issueContent = context.payload.issue.body;
    if (issueContent.includes('AfricaCryptoChainx') || issueContent.includes('CCXT Wallet')) {
      const issueComment = context.issue({ body: 'Keyword related to AfricaCryptoChainx-CCXT wallet transaction found in issue' });
      await context.octokit.issues.createComment(issueComment);
    }
  });

  app.on(['pull_request.opened', 'pull_request.synchronize'], async (context) => {
    const filesChanged = await context.octokit.pulls.listFiles(context.repo({
      pull_number: context.payload.pull_request.number
    }));
    
    if (filesChanged.data.some(file => file.filename.includes('transactions/'))) {
      const prComment = context.issue({ body: 'Relevant transaction file changed in pull request' });
      await context.octokit.issues.createComment(prComment);
    }
  });
};
```

### Using Your Project Information

1. **Update the Workflow File:**
   - Ensure that the keyword filtering includes relevant terms like 'AfricaCryptoChainx' and 'CCXT Wallet'.
   - Replace `'transactions/'` with the specific directory or file path relevant to your wallet transaction files.

2. **Deploy the Probot Bot:**
   - Set up and deploy your Probot bot with the provided `index.js` file to a hosting platform like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). ### GitHub Actions Workflow with CodeQL and Python
