OpenACC is a directive-based parallel programming model for C, C++, and Fortran.
It is most often associated with directive-based programming for GPU computers,
but has also been used for programming multi-core CPUs and FPGAs. OpenACC is
developed and maintained by members of the OpenACC standard organization.
