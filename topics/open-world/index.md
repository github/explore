In video games, an open world is a virtual world in which the player can explore and approach objectives freely, as opposed to a world with more linear gameplay.[1][2] While games have used open-world designs since the 1980s, the implementation in Grand Theft Auto III (2001) set a standard that has been used since.[3]
