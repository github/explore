A large language model (LLM) is a type of machine learning model designed for understanding, generating, and interacting with human language. These models are trained on extensive datasets containing text from books, articles, websites, and other sources to learn patterns, context, and semantics in language. LLMs are widely used in applications like chatbots, code generation, translation, summarization, and more. They are often built using transformer architectures and are central to the field of generative AI.
