**Single-page applications** (**SPA**) are client-side applications that don't route via different pages but rather combine the logic for different contents into one page. This was historically achieved via hashbang URI fragments (`#!`). With the introduction of the [`pushState` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/History/pushState), this state can now be properly used within the browser history, in bookmarks and sharing.

Another important point for SPA was the lack of proper [SEO](https://github.com/topics/seo) but developers and frameworks found ways around that.
