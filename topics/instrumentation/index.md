In computer science, **instrumentation** is a technique that consists of inserting specific instructions into a program to monitor and/or analyze its performance, functionality, or behavior, but without changing how it behaves.
It can be done statically, changing the program before executing it, or dynamically, inserting instructions while it's being executed.
