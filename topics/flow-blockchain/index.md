Flow blockchain is a scalable, fast, and developer-friendly blockchain platform designed to support high-throughput applications, such as games and digital collectibles, without the need for layer-two solutions or sharding.

Unlike traditional blockchain architectures, Flow utilizes a [unique multi-node design](https://flow.com/primer#primer-how-flow-works), where different types of nodes perform distinct tasks - execution, verification, collection, and consensus. This design allows for significant improvements in scalability while preserving decentralization and security.
