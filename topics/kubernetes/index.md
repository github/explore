Kubernetes (commonly referred to as "K8s") is an open source system for automating deployment, scaling and management of containerized applications originally designed by Google and donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It aims to provide a "platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts". It supports a range of container tools, including Docker.
