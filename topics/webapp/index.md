A web application is any program that is accessed over a network connection using HTTP, usually via a web browser. Web apps do not have to be installed on a user's device; they are run from a remote server. This differs from mobile apps, which are installed on the user's mobile device, and desktop applications, which are installed on the user's computer. Common examples of web apps include Flash games, online calculators, calendars, Gmail, and Facebook.
