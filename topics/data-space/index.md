A **data space** is a decentralized, federated infrastructure that facilitates the secure and trustworthy exchange of data between multiple participants. Unlike centralized data lakes or platforms, a data space preserves **data sovereignty**, meaning the data owner retains complete control over who can access their data and under what conditions. It relies on common governance frameworks, shared standards, interoperability protocols, and trust services to enable a fair and competitive data economy.
