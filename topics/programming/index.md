**Programming** is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result. It involves tasks such as analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (coding). The field of programming spans many languages and technologies, forming the backbone of software development and information technology.
