Action-role-playing games (ARPGs) are a subgenre of role-playing video games that emphasize real-time combat, where the player has direct control over the characters as opposed to turn or menu-based combat. This genre combines elements of action games with role-playing games, allowing the player to level up their character and acquire new abilities and items as they progress through the game. ARPGs often feature hack-and-slash gameplay and may also include elements of dungeon-crawl and MMORPGs.
