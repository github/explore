ALE Psych is a Friday Night Funkin’ modding engine built on Psych Engine 0.7.3. It allows users to add new menus, events, stages, and gameplay changes without modifying the engine’s source files.

Mods can use Lua and HScript to create custom classes, script song events, and control various gameplay features.

ALE Psych differs from the original Psych Engine in several ways, including updates to loading, better class support, and a built-in console for debugging. These changes help modders develop and test their projects more easily.
