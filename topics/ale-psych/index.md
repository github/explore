ALE Psych is a modding engine for Friday Night Funkin’ built on Psych Engine 0.7.3. It provides a structured environment for creating custom stages, menus, events, and gameplay features without modifying the engine’s source code.

The engine supports Lua and HScript for defining behaviors, UI elements, and logic directly from a mod’s folder. It also uses JSON files to configure options, credits, and engine properties, allowing creators to organize and manage mod content cleanly.

ALE Psych includes various improvements and quality-of-life features over the original Psych Engine, such as redesigned loading systems, support for custom classes, optional 3D objects, and an integrated console for debugging. These additions make it a practical and flexible choice for developers building structured and maintainable FNF mods.
