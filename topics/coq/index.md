Coq is a formal proof management system. It provides a formal language to write
mathematical definitions, executable algorithms and theorems together with an
environment for semi-interactive development of machine-checked proofs. Typical
applications include the certification of properties of programming languages,
the formalization of mathematics and teaching.
