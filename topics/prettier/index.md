**Prettier** is an opinionated code formatter created by James Long. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary. Prettier supports many programming languages and integrates with most editors. It is widely used in the JavaScript community to maintain code style consistency, reduce debates on code styling, and improve code readability.
