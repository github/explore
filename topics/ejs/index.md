**EJS** (**E**mbedded **J**ava**S**cript templating). is a templating language that allows JavaScript to be integrated into the creation of HTML files through embedded statements. It unifies the two languages to assist the creation of complex HTML documents at build time. EJS uses vanilla JavaScript so that a minimal amount of new knowledge is needed to use it.
