WordPress is a popular content management system, used for websites and blogs. WordPress is written in PHP and MySQL and is designed to be flexible and user-friendly.

It allows the addition of functionalities through plugins. These plugins make WordPress one of the most versatile and widely used platforms for forums, community social networks, ecommerce (WooCommerce), intranet websites, education and learning platforms (LMS), magazines and newspapers, etc.

WordPress has its open source version at its "org" domain address, to be installed on any compatible server, and its cloud SaaS version at "com", with a managed and ready-to-use infrastructure.
