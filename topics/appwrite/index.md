Appwrite is an end-to-end platform for building web, mobile, native, or backend apps, packaged as a set of Docker microservices. It includes both a backend server and a fully integrated hosting solution for deploying static and server-side rendered frontends.

Appwrite abstracts the complexity and repetitiveness required to build modern apps from scratch and allows you to build secure, full-stack applications faster.
