A geographic information system (GIS) is a conceptualized framework that provides the ability to capture and 
analyze spatial and geographic data. GIS applications (or GIS apps) are computer-based tools that allow the 
user to create interactive queries (user-created searches), store and edit spatial and non-spatial data, 
analyze spatial information output, and visually share the results of these operations by presenting them as 
maps.
