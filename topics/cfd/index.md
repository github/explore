Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a specialized area within fluid mechanics that employs numerical methods and algorithms to simulate the behavior of fluids. It enables engineers and scientists to model and analyze complex flow phenomena, such as air flow around an aircraft wing, water currents in rivers, or heat transfer in industrial equipment. CFD tools provide detailed insights into fluid behavior under various conditions, allowing for optimization of designs, prediction of performance, and troubleshooting of issues in many fields including aerospace, automotive, energy, and environmental engineering. By solving the governing equations of fluid motion (Navier-Stokes equations), CFD can predict velocity, pressure, temperature, and other important variables throughout the domain of interest.
