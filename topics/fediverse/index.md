The Fediverse (a portmanteau of "federation" and "universe") is a network of interconnected servers (or so called instances) that make up federated publishing websites similar to Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. It is made up by federation protocols like [OStatus](https://www.w3.org/community/ostatus/), and [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/), and server software, most notably [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social), [Misskey](https://github.com/misskey-dev/misskey), and many others.
