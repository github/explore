The Software-Challenge Germany is a programming competition held by the CAU Kiel and FH Wedel. A new board game is chosen annually and implemented as a computer game by the organizers.

The task for the student teams is to write a client that will play the game against the clients of other participants. Inexperienced students can always get help from tutors of the CAU Kiel.
Dedicated students have the chance to win one of up to 100 scholarships for the CAU Kiel.
