Chrome extensions are add-ons for Chromium-based browsers, such as Google Chrome, which enable users to customize the Chrome browsing experience. Built using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, extensions make use of various APIs supported by the browser. Extensions are typically downloaded from online marketplaces, with the Chrome Web Store being the most widely used. Chrome extensions work on most Chromium browsers, not just Google Chrome developed by Google.
