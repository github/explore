üê† Babel is a compiler created by [Sebastian McKenzie](https://github.com/kittens) in 2014 to convert ES6 to ES5 (originally called 6to5). It has since become a toolchain that enables developers to write any next generation JavaScript and serves as a testing ground for proposals from [TC39](https://github.com/tc39), the technical committee that specifies [ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript). Babel can also convert [JSX syntax](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) and strip out type annotations from both [Flow](https://flow.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Babel is built out of plugins. Compose your own transformation pipeline using [plugins written by the community](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/babel-plugin) or [write your own](https://github.com/thejameskyle/babel-handbook).
