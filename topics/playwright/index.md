Playwright provides a set of APIs to automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers. By using the Playwright API, you can write scripts to create new browser pages, navigate to URLs, and interact with elements on a page. Along with a test runner, Playwright can be used to automate user interactions to validate and test web applications.
