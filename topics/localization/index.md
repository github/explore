**Software localization** (also spelled "localisation", often abbreviated to **l10n** — this is a numeronym, where the “10” stands for the 10 letters between the first letter “l” and the last letter “n”) means translation of a software interface and messages to another language plus adaptation of some formats (e.g. measures, dates and currency) plus adaptation to local cultures.
