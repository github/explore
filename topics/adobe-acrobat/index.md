Adobe Acrobat is a software suite used for creating, viewing, and editing PDF (Portable Document Format) documents. It is developed and maintained by Adobe Systems and is available for Windows and macOS.

One of the main functions of Adobe Acrobat is to allow users to create and edit PDF documents. This includes features such as adding text, images, and links to a PDF, as well as the ability to fill out and submit PDF forms. Adobe Acrobat also includes tools for organizing and managing PDF documents, such as the ability to merge multiple PDFs into a single document and add digital signatures.

In addition to its editing and management capabilities, Adobe Acrobat also includes a PDF reader, allowing users to view PDFs on their computers without the need for additional software.
