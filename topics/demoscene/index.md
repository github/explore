The demoscene is a worldwide community of artists and programmers creating visuals and music using programming techniques. They use realtime rendering to create pieces of art that are akin to music videos or short films; they utilize a variety of computer platforms ranging from modern to vintage, and sometimes their work adheres to arbitrarily set size limitations.
