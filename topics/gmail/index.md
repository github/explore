Gmail is an email service provided by Google. With Gmail, you can send and receive emails, block spam, create an address book, and perform other basic email tasks. It also has a built-in-chat feature, with which you can send someone an instant message or use the voice and video chat feature if your computer has a microphone and/or webcam.
