Ratchet is a set of libraries that allows PHP developers to create real-time, bidirectional applications between clients and servers over WebSockets. The organization provides the following repositories: Ratchet as a WebSocket server, Pawl as a WebSocket client, and RFC6455 which is an I/O-agnostic library for WebSocket protocol handling.
