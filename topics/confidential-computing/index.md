Confidential Computing is the protection of data in use by performing computation in a hardware-based, attested Trusted Execution Environment. 
A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is an environment that provides a level of assurance of the following three properties: data integrity, data confidentiality, and code integrity. 
TEEs may have additional attributes such as code confidentiality, programmability, recoverability, and attestability.
Confidential Computing aims to reduce the ability for the owner/operator/pwner of a platform to access data and code inside TEEs sufficiently such that this path is not an economically or logically viable attack during execution.
