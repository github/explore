**Continuous Deployment** (**CD**)  is a software engineering approach in which software functionalities are delivered frequently and through automated deployments.

Continuous deployment contrasts with continuous delivery (also abbreviated CD), a similar approach in which software functionalities are also frequently delivered and deemed to be potentially capable of being deployed, but are actually not deployed. As such, continuous deployment can be viewed as a more complete form of automation than continuous delivery.
