**Postman** is an API platform for developers for building and using APIs. This tool cannot only make requests with different HTTP verbs to different URLs, it also offers
* using variables (collection, environment, etc.) in different places (path, query string, etc.)
* Collections: Group requests in folders, export collections and write documentation for them
* Scripting: Modify the request before sending as well as test and visualize its results
* Design APIs: Create OpenAPI schema files and store them in your version control system
