**CI/CD** is a build automation strategy and part of DevOps

* **[Continuous integration](https://github.com/topics/continuous-integration)**: Frequent merging of several small changes into a main branch.
* **[Continuous delivery](https://github.com/topics/continuous-delivery)**: When teams produce software in short cycles with high speed and frequency so that reliable software can be released at any time, and with a simple and repeatable deployment process when deciding to deploy.
* **[Continuous deployment](https://github.com/topics/continuous-deployment)**: When new software functionality is rolled out completely automatically.
