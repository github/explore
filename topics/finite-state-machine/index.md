A **finite-state machine** (FSM), **finite-state automaton** (FSA), or simply **state machine** is a mathematical [model of computation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation) and an [abstract machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_machine) that can be in exactly one of a finite number of states at any given time.
The FSM can change from one state to another in response to some inputs; the change from one state to another is called a *transition*.
An FSM is defined by a list of its states, its initial state, and the inputs that trigger each transition.

In computer science, FSM are widely used in modeling of application behavior ([control theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory)), design of [hardware digital systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics), [software engineering](https://github.com/topics/software-engineering), [compilers](https://github.com/topics/compiler), [network protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_protocol), and [computational linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics).
