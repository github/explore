Low code is a software development approach that uses graphical development environments to simplify the process of building applications. Low-code development platforms or low-code platforms are a category of software development platforms that are designed to enable rapid application development. Rather than requiring developers to write code, low-code platforms provide a graphical user interface (GUI) with which users can configure and customize applications. Low-code platforms may also provide a visual programming language that allows users to create applications without writing code.
