Racket is a general-purpose, programming language and a platform for programming language design and implementation. 
Racket supports multiple paradigms: functional programming, object-oriented programming, Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) and Language Oriented Programming with powerful macros and parsing libraries.
Static type checking, type classes and gradual typing support the development of large code bases.
