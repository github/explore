ComputerCraft is a modification for [Minecraft](https://github.com/topics/minecraft) that’s all about computer programming. It allows you to build in-game Computers and Turtle Robots, and write programs for them using the [Lua](https://github.com/topics/lua) programming language. The addition of programming to [Minecraft](https://github.com/topics/minecraft) opens up a wide variety of new possibilities for automation and creativity. If you’ve never programmed before, it also serves as excellent way to learn a real world skill in a fun, familiar environment.

**Development for ComputerCraft has ceased, but there is a fork called [CC: Tweaked](https://github.com/topics/computercraft-tweaked) that offers enhanced performance, improved stability, and a wealth of new features.**
