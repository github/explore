Global climate change refers to the rise of earth's temperature, caused by human factors. It originates from the greenhouse effect of certain gases in our atmosphere like carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) or methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) that block the escaping heat. The concentration of these gases has risen dramatically by human impact since the mid of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, with the burning of fossil fuels (oil and gas) and deforestation being main causes of this rise. The observed and expected effects include more and longer periods of draught, wildfires and an increased number of extreme weather events.
