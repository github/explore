Mastodon is a large social media network built as a decentralized federation of independently operated servers. It has a strong focus on privacy and anti-abuse features. Mastodon's server-side technology is Ruby on Rails, and its front end is written in JavaScript (React.js and Redux). It implements both the [OStatus](https://www.w3.org/community/ostatus/) and [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/) protocols and is thus interoperable with other social networks. [There are several client applications for different platforms available.](https://github.com/tootsuite/documentation/blob/master/Using-Mastodon/Apps.md)
