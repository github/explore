Mastodon is a free and open source microblogging network built as a decentralized federation of independently-operated servers. The server-side technology is Ruby on Rails, and the front end is written in JavaScript (React.js and Redux). It implements the [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/) and [WebFinger](https://webfinger.net/) protocols for interoperability with other social networks. [There are several client applications for different platforms available.](https://joinmastodon.org/apps).
