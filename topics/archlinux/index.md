Arch Linux is a lightweight and flexible Linux distribution that aims to keep things simple. It is based on x86-64 architectures and is composed of both free and nonfree software. Arch Linux encourages community involvement and supports a rolling release model, which means that users receive updates to the software as soon as they are released, rather than waiting for a new version of the distribution to be released. Arch Linux also has a powerful package management system, which allows users to easily install, update, and remove software packages. Additionally, Arch Linux is highly customizable, allowing users to tailor their system to their specific needs and preferences.
