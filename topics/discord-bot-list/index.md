A bot is an automated Discord account. A Discord Bot list is a website that displays these Discord bots. Sites provide an easy place for Discord bot owners to share their bots throughout Discord, and may include a way to support bots via a dedicated support button. This is one of the main avenues by which a bot can become popular on Discord.
