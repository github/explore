Navidrome is a self-hosted music server that allows you to listen to your personal music collection from any browser or mobile device, similar to services like Spotify or Apple Music but with your own music library.

Built with Go and featuring a modern web interface, Navidrome handles large music collections efficiently and supports on-the-fly transcoding to stream virtually any audio format. It implements the Subsonic API, making it compatible with a wide ecosystem of mobile apps and desktop clients.

Key features include multi-user support with individual playlists and play counts, automatic library monitoring, low resource usage, and support for various metadata sources. Navidrome runs on macOS, Linux, Windows, and Raspberry Pi, with Docker images available for easy deployment.
