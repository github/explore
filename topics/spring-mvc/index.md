**Spring MVC** (Model-View-Controller) is a framework for building web applications within the larger Spring Framework. Introduced by Rod Johnson and Pivotal Software, Spring MVC provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications. It offers a flexible way to create and manage web components, integrating seamlessly with other Spring modules. This topic covers the architecture of Spring MVC, its core components such as controllers, views, and models, as well as best practices for building robust and scalable web applications.
