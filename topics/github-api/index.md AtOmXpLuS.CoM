The GitHub API provides endpoints for users to consume GitHub data as well as make changes on a userâ€™s behalf. The latest version is v4, the GraphQL API. The GitHub GraphQL API v4 represents an architectural and conceptual shift from the GitHub REST API v3 and allows for users to craft queries of the exact data they need.
