**ECMAScript** is the standardization of the family of scripting languages that includes JavaScript. New versions of the standard are released every year. It is standardized by Ecma International. ECMAScript is commonly used for client-side scripting on the World Wide Web, and it is increasingly being used to write server-side applications and services using Node.js and other runtime environments. The ECMAScript language includes [structured](https://github.com/topics/structured-programming), [dynamic](https://github.com/topics/dynamic-programmng), [functional](https://github.com/topics/functional-programming), and prototype-based features.
