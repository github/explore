A parser turns its input (often text in form of a file) into a more advantageous representation (usually a certain data structure in memory) to perform a specific task.  
  
Common examples include:
* parsers for markup languages (e.g. HTML/Markdown etc)
* parsers for data-serialization formats (e.g. JSON/XML/YAML etc)
* parsers used as part of/in conjunction with a compiler (in this case, the parser consumes the tokenized input emitted by the Lexer and ultimately feeds the resulting parse tree/concrete syntax tree into the compiler)
