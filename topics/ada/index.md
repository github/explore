Ada is a structured, statically typed, imperative, and object-oriented high-level programming language. It has built-in language support for design by contract, strong typing, explicit concurrency, tasks, synchronous message passing, and protected objects. Ada improves code safety and maintainability by using the compiler to find errors in favor of runtime errors. Ada is an international technical standard, jointly defined by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) as ISO/IEC 8652:2012.
