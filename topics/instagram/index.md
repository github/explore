Instagram is a photo and video sharing social networking service. The app allows users to upload media that can be edited with filters and organized by hashtags and geographical tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations and view trending content. Users can like and comment on photos and follow other users to add their content to a personal feed as well as send private messages to their friends via the Instagram Direct feature.
