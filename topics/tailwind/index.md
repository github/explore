Tailwind is an utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development written in PostCSS and configured through JavaScript, making it highly customizable by design. Tailwind doesn’t have a default theme nor built-in UI components. This means it has no opinion about how your site should look and doesn’t impose design decisions that can be difficult to undo.
