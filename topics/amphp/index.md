Amp is a non-blocking concurrency library for PHP. Newer versions make use of fibers to integrate well with existing interfaces and allow for transparent non-blocking I/O. Older versions make heavy use of generator-based coroutines. It's made by the developers that brought native fiber support to PHP 8.1.
