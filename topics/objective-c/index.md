Objective-C works on the foundations of ANSI C. Compared to other object-oriented languages based on C, Objective-C is very dynamic. Dynamism enables the construction of sophisticated development tools. Since Objective-C incorporates C, one gets all the benefits of C when working within Objective-C.
