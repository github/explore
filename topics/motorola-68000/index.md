The Motorola 68000 is a 16/32-bit microprocessor (family) designed by Motorola in 1979. It was the first 16/32-bit microprocessor to be widely used. The 68000 is a CISC processor, with a 16-bit internal data bus and 24-bit address bus. It has a 32-bit data bus in the 68020 and later versions.

The 68000 was used in many personal computers, workstations, and game consoles, including the Apple Macintosh, Atari ST, Commodore Amiga, and the Nintendo Entertainment System.

The 68000 was succeeded by the 68020, 68030, 68040, and 68060, and by the PowerPC 601, 603, 604, 620, and 750.
