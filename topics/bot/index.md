A bot is an application that runs automated, usually repetitive tasks over the Internet. Bots are used in place of humans to relieve humans of repetitive tasks, since tasks like crawling the web for certain words are boring in the extreme for humans. Many bots abound on the Internet, and a large portion of those run constantly, as changes might happen that they need to take into account.
