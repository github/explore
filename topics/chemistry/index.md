Chemistry is a branch of natural science that studies substances, their structure, properties, and reactions when they combine or separate. It plays a crucial role in understanding the composition of matter and its transformations. Chemistry can be divided into several sub-disciplines including organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry, analytical chemistry, and biochemistry. These areas explore everything from the synthesis of new molecules to the chemical processes happening within living organisms.
