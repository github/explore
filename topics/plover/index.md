Plover is a free, open source, cross-platform stenography engine with support for a variety of hardware, including stenotype machines, hobbyist machines, and computer keyboards. It aims to bring stenography to anyone for free.

Stenography is a form of shorthand writing/typing that can achieve speeds of over 200 words per minute. Unlike typing, where you usually press one key down at a time to output a single character at a time, machine stenography involves pressing multiple keys down at a time to produce a syllable, word, phrase or more. This allows people to write text at much higher speeds, such as for transcription or captioning. People also use stenography for writing, programming, and day-to-day computer use.
