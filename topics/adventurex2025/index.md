AdventureX 2025 is China's largest hackathon, taking place in Hangzhou from July 23 to 27. This 72-hour innovation challenge for young developers offers free entry, encourages tech for good, and promotes open source development. Let's once again lose sleep for creation, embrace the uncertain 72 hours. Not just another competition, but a stage for young changemakers, where projects address social issues and technology redefines what's possible - a miracle machine for the youth.
