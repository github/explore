Popularized by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org), wikis aim to be a comprehensive reference material to either specific or general subjects. Wikis typically consist of lots of individual articles, updated by a team of volunteer writers.

Wikis are frequently hosted using open source software due to the open source nature of HTML; a popular example amongst these projects is [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/), being repsonsible for Wikipedia's backend.

GitHub allows for each repository to host [a wiki of their own](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis), allowing for detailed documentation of any repository's function. GitHub wikis may be relevant to continued development, relevant to those utilizing a repository's application, or a repository's entire purpose.
