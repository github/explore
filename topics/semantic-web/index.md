The Semantic Web is an extension of the World Wide Web through standards set by the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://github.com/topics/w3c). The goal of the Semantic Web is to make Internet data machine-readable.

This can be seen in various aspects of web development, one being [semantic HTML](https://github.com/topics/semantic-html) as a way to give your [markup](https://github.com/topics/markup) meaning, [microformats](https://github.com/topics/microformats) like [schema.org](https://github.com/topics/schema-org) or [linked-data](https://github.com/topics/linked-data) like [json-ld](https://github.com/topics/json-ld). Another aspect is from the opposite perspective: Reading and interpreting data. This can be done with metadata via [RDF](https://github.com/topics/rdf).
