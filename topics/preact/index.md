**Preact.js** is a lightweight React alternative with the same API.

# Similarities to React
* ES6 Class, hooks, and Functional Components
* Compatibility via a simple preact/compat alias
* JSX, VDOM, DevTools, HMR, SSR.
* Cross-browser compatibility
* Transparent asynchronous rendering with a pluggable scheduler

# Differences from React
* Works in the browser without any transpilation steps
* Syntactic sugar
    * `props`, `state` and `context` are passed to `render()`
    * Standard HTML attributes like `class` and `for` can be used instead of `className` and `htmlFor`
