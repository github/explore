**Eloquent** is an ORM which is part of the Laravel framework. When using Eloquent, each database table has a corresponding "Model" that is used to interact with that table. Eloquent models are usually stored in `app/Models` and extend from Laravel's model base class `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model`. In addition to retrieving records from the database table, Eloquent models allow you to insert, update, and delete records from the table as well.
