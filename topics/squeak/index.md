Squeak is a live programming system for the object-oriented, reflective, and simple programming language Smalltalk. Squeak is self-supporting, i.e., it is implemented and modifiable entirely in itself. Squeak is used in research, education, and industry. Squeak is free open source software and runs on all major platforms inside the OpenSmalltalk VM.
