Burner hardware wallets are temporary, disposable devices designed for secure cryptocurrency storage and transactions over short periods. These wallets prioritize security through isolation and limited exposure, making them ideal for quick transactions, testing environments, or situations where long-term storage is not required.

Unlike traditional hardware wallets that are designed for long-term storage, burner hardware wallets are intended to be used briefly and then discarded or reset. This approach minimizes security risks by reducing the attack surface and exposure time of private keys. They are particularly popular in the Ethereum ecosystem and other EVM-compatible blockchain networks.

Key characteristics of burner hardware wallets include:

- **Temporary usage**: Designed for short-term storage and quick transactions
- **Enhanced security**: Reduced attack surface through limited exposure time
- **EVM compatibility**: Support for Ethereum and other EVM-compatible chains
- **Open source**: Many implementations are open source, allowing for community verification and customization
- **Disposable nature**: Can be safely discarded or reset after use

These wallets are commonly used by developers for testing, traders for quick transactions, and individuals who prioritize security through isolation rather than long-term storage solutions.
