[Burner](https://burner.pro) hardware wallets are affordable, credit-card-sized crypto wallets built for gifting and everyday use. These devices store private keys on secure chips and use PIN-based authentication for access control, unlike traditional hardware wallets that require seed phrase management. Burner offers two separate wallets: Burner Ethereum and Burner Bitcoin.

This topic covers open source projects that are compatible with Burner hardware wallets.
