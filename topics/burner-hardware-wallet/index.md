Burner hardware wallets are affordable, credit-card-sized crypto wallets designed for gifting and everyday use. Built with the same secure chip technology found in premium devices like Ledger or Trezor, Burner cards eliminate the complexity of traditional hardware wallets by removing seed phrases, apps, and complicated setup processes.

Key features of Burner hardware wallets:

- **No seed phrases**: Uses PIN-based authentication, eliminating the hassle and risk of managing recovery phrases
- **Instant setup**: Tap the card against your smartphone to launch BurnerOS, a secure web-based interfaceâ€”no app downloads, plugins, or firmware updates required
- **Offline protection**: Private keys are self-generated and stored on a tamper-resistant secure chip. They never leave the card
- **Perfect for gifting**: Load ETH, BTC, or stablecoins like USD II onto the card. Works like a gift card, but the recipient receives full self-custody of the crypto
- **Credit-card form factor**: Combines the convenience of fintech-style burner cards with the simplicity of crypto's temporary wallets

This topic covers open source projects that are built with Burner-compatibility, allowing developers to integrate Burner card functionality into their applications and services. These projects enable users to interact with Burner cards across various platforms and use cases, making cryptocurrency more accessible for everyday transactions and gifting scenarios.
