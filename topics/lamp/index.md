LAMP is a bundle of software consisting of four open source programs.
It is one of the most popular software categories for servers.

A usual LAMP server includes:
* **L**inux (operating system)
* **A**pache (web server)
* **M**ySQL (database software)
* **P**HP, **P**erl, or **P**ython (programming language)

Most Linux distributions include the components of a LAMP server.
There are also some other variants of LAMP, such WAMP, which runs on Windows
instead of Linux.
