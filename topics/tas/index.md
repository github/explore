A tool-assisted speedrun is a video game speedrun that has been optimized via TAS software, a special set of tools made to assist with speedrunning. These tools usually include frame advance, which can step through frames one at a time and pause gameplay, TASInput, which can send precise controller, mouse, and keyboard inputs to the game, and savestates, which can be used to return to an earlier state of gameplay to further optimize. Tool-assisted speedruns are not accepted on regular speedrun leaderboards due to the modified gameplay.
