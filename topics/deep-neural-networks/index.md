Deep neural networks (DNNs) are a class of artificial neural networks (ANNs) that are deep in the sense that they have many layers of hidden units between the input and output layers. Deep neural networks are a type of deep learning, which is a type of machine learning. Deep neural networks are used in a variety of applications, including speech recognition, computer vision, and natural language processing.
