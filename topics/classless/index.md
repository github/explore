These frameworks provide a set of pre-designed and pre-styled components that can be easily added to a web page without the need to write custom CSS classes. Classless CSS Frameworks are a great option for developers looking to create simple and fast-loading web pages without sacrificing design and style. They are also ideal for small projects or prototypes where the overhead of a full CSS framework may not be necessary.
