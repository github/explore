**OpenID connect** (**OIDC**) is an authentication layer on top of the [OAuth 2.0 authorization framework](https://github.com/topics/oauth2). Beside [SAML](https://github.com/topics/) it's widely known for being used as a [single sign-on](https://github.com/topics/sso) method. It uses [REST](https://github.com/topics/rest-api) and [JSON](https://github.com/topics/json) for communication with the identity provider.
