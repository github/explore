FastAPI is a high performance, easy to learn, fast to code, and ready for production Python 3.7+ framework. Its performance is on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). It's intuitive and standards-based (based on API standards like OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema).
