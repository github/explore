Before there were graphical user interfaces, text-based user interfaces were used to issue commands to a computer. Like GUIs, they may use the entire screen area and accept mouse and other inputs. They may also use color and often structure the display using special graphical characters such as ┌ and ╣, referred to in Unicode as the "box drawing" set.
