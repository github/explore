Team Win Recovery Project (TWRP), pronounced "twerp", is an open source software custom recovery image for Android-based devices. It provides a touchscreen-enabled interface that allows users to install third-party firmware and back up the current system which are functions often unsupported by stock recovery images. It is, therefore, often installed when flashing, installing, or rooting Android devices, although it isn't dependent on a device being rooted prior to installation.
