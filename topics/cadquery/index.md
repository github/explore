CadQuery is an intuitive, easy-to-use Python library for building parametric 3D CAD models. It has several goals:

* Build models with scripts that are as close as possible to how youâ€™d describe the object to a human, using a standard, already established programming language.
* Create parametric models that can be very easily customized.
* Output high quality CAD formats like STEP and AMF in addition to traditional STL.
* Provide a non-proprietary, plain text model format that can be edited and executed with only a web browser.

CadQuery 2 is based on [OCP](https://github.com/CadQuery/OCP), which is a set of Python bindings for the open source [OpenCascade](http://www.opencascade.com/) modelling kernel.
