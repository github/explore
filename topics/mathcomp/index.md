Mathematical Components is a repository of formalized mathematics developed using
the Coq proof assistant. This project finds its roots in the formal proof of
the Four Color Theorem. It has been used for large scale formalization projects,
including a formal proof of the Odd Order (Feit-Thompson) Theorem.
