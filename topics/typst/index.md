Typst is a markup language for typesetting documents. It is designed as a substitute for tools such as LaTeX that is easy to learn, fast, and versatile.

Typst is suitable for writing long-form texts, including essays, articles, scientific papers, books and reports. Furthermore, it is ideal for documents containing mathematical notation, such as papers in mathematics, physics, and engineering.
