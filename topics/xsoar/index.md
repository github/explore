Cortex XSOAR is a Security Automation platform sold by Palo Alto Networks enabling Security Operations teams to develop low-code playbooks to (semi-)automatically conduct the response to security alerts/incidents.
The SOAR in XSOAR stands for "Security Orchestration, Automation and Response".
XSOAR provides all kinds of open source community managed integrations for platforms/services commonly used by Security Operations teams.
Before being bought by PAN, XSOAR was a fully open sourced project known as Demisto.
