**Single sign-on** (**SSO**) is an authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID to any of several related, yet independent, software systems. SSO supporters place emphasis on it reducing the risk of password fatigue and improvement of usability in terms of perceived corperate identity between different services of the same provider.

Conversely, **single sign-off** or **single log-out** (**SLO**) is the property whereby a single action of signing out terminates access to multiple software systems.
