In computer science and software engineering, Alloy is a declarative
specification language for expressing complex structural constraints and
behavior in a software system. Alloy provides a simple structural modeling tool
based on first-order logic. Alloy is targeted at the creation of micro-models
that can then be automatically checked for correctness. Alloy specifications
can be checked using the Alloy Analyzer.
