Fair Source is software that is safe for companies to share and developers to use. We need it because, historically, Open Source has been an ambiguous term, applied to both community and commercial projects. By introducing a new term for commercial projects, Fair Source, we can set better expectations with developers, reduce pressure to change the Open Source Definition, and free up more companies to share their core software products.
