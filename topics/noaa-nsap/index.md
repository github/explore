The National Stock Assessment Program (NSAP) provides leadership, advocacy, and support for NOAA Fisheries' national stock assessment enterprise, while developing innovative science and tools for management and transitioning this science and tools to operations by fostering communication and communities of practice.  Through coordination at the national level, NSAP facilitates strategic alignment of stock assessment science activities between regions to improve interregional collaboration, streamline efforts, and work towards national solutions. These approaches ultimately drive improvements in innovation and reduce costs. Additional core activities for NSAP include strategic planning; administration of the EASA budget line to invest in regional stock assessments; national coordination, tracking, and reporting on stock assessment activities and initiatives; and research and  development of national quantitative computing tools.
