The Kokkos C++ Performance Portability Ecosystem is a production level solution for writing modern C++ applications in a hardware agnostic way. The Ecosystem consists of multiple libraries addressing the primary concerns for developing and maintaining applications in a portable way. The three main components are the [Kokkos Core Programming Model](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos), the [Kokkos Kernels Math Libraries ](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-kernels) and the [Kokkos Profiling and Debugging Tools](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos-tools).
