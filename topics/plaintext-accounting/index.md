***Plain text accounting*** is a way of doing bookkeeping and accounting with plain text files
and scriptable, command-line-friendly software, such as
[Ledger](https://ledger-cli.org/), [hledger](https://hledger.org/), or
[Beancount](https://beancount.github.io/).
Benefits include version control, scriptability, data portability and privacy.
See https://plaintextaccounting.org and https://wiki.plaintextaccounting.org for more details.

If you have a PTA-ish project on Github, consider adding the `plaintext-accounting` (*) topic in your repo settings.
