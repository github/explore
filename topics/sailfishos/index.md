Sailfish OS is a Linux-based mobile operating system. It is an continuation of the MeeGo operating system made by Nokia
and Intel. While in the past Jolla has sold devices with Sailfish OS preinstalled, nowadays consumers need to install
it themselves.

Sailfish OS applications are usually written in C++, Python or Rust and make use of the Silica widget toolkit, which
is based around Qt Quick. Other programming languages and UI toolkits can also be used, but are not officially supported.
