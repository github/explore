**AngularJS** (also known as **Angular 1**) is a discontinued free and open-source JavaScript-based web framework for developing single-page applications. It supports both model–view–controller (MVC) and model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectures. It is superceded by its second version [Angular](/topics/angular), a complete rewrite in TypeScript.
