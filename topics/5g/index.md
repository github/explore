5G is a cellular network technology standardized by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). The 5G architecture consists of two parts: the Next-Generation Radio Access Network (NG-RAN) and the 5G Core Network (5GC). The 5GC is a service-oriented software-defined system composed of modular network functions. The Radio Access Technology (RAT) used by the NG-RAN is called 5G New Radio (5G NR).
