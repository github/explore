The Einstein problem in plane geometry involves finding a single prototile that can tessellate a plane only in a nonperiodic way, known as an "einstein." This term plays on the German phrase "ein Stein," meaning "one stone." The strictest form of this problem was solved in 2023, extending the exploration of nonperiodic tiling and related geometric concepts.
