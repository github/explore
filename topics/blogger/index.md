Blogger Service is a content management system which enables multi-user blogs with time-stamped entries. Pyra Labs developed it before being acquired by Google in 2003. Google hosts the blogs, which can be accessed through a subdomain of `blogspot.com`. Blogs can also be accessed from a user-owned custom domain (such as `www.example.com`) by using DNS facilities to direct a domain to Google's servers. A user can have up to 100 blogs or websites per account.
