CSS Modules are CSS files in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default. They compile to a low-level interchange format called [Interoperable CSS](https://github.com/css-modules/icss), but are written like normal CSS files. The ability to explicitly state dependencies eliminates the need to avoid naming conflicts in the global scope.

For a more colorful introduction, see [this blog post](https://glenmaddern.com/articles/css-modules), which was written by one of the authors of the project near the time of its release.
