Computer (symbolic) algebra systems and libraries are used for manipulations with symbolic mathematical expressions.
Usually, those libraries are capable of some calculus operations (differentiation, integration, finding the limit, etc.) and numeric manipulations.
The idea is to avoid floating number operations by computing the exact result instead.
