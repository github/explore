Containerlab labs belong to Git, and GitHub is the most popular service for hosting public projects. To make public labs easily discoverable in a distributed fashion we introduced the `clab-topo` topic that anyone can [add to the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics) that features a containerlab topology file.

This will list your lab among others so that others can discover it.
