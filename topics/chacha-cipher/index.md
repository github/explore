ChaCha is a family of stream ciphers developed by Daniel J. Bernstein. It is part of the popular authenticated encryption algorithm ChaCha20-Poly1305.

The canonical 20-round version is ChaCha20, though the faster, reduced-round variants ChaCha8 and ChaCha12 also see some use.
The XChaCha family features an extended nonce.
