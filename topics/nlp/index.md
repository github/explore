Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of computer science that studies how computers and humans interact. In the 1950s, Alan Turing published an article that proposed a measure of intelligence, now called the Turing test. More modern techniques, such as deep learning, have produced results in the fields of language modeling, parsing, and natural-language tasks.
