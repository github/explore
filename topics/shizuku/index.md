Shizuku is an Android framework that provides a way for applications to use system APIs that would normally require elevated privileges. By leveraging Android Debug Bridge (ADB) or root access, Shizuku creates a bridge between regular applications and system-level APIs, allowing developers to build powerful tools without requiring users to root their devices. This makes it particularly useful for system utility apps, file managers, and other applications that need deeper system integration while maintaining device security.
