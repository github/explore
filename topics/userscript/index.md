A userscript is a kind of lightweight and less privileged browser extension written in JavaScript used to modify webpages. Userscripts may use the special API, usually referred as [`GM_API`](https://wiki.greasespot.net/Greasemonkey_Manual:API), allowing them to bypass [same-origin policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy) and store data in separate storage not accessible to web pages. The technology was initially introduced in the [GreaseMonkey](https://github.com/greasemonkey/greasemonkey) extension for [Firefox web browser](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/), and then spread to other browsers, sometimes built-in, like in [Presto-based Opera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presto_\(layout_engine\)), sometimes with help of extensions, like in [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org)-based browsers. The most famous catalogs of userscripts are [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/) and [OpenUserJS](https://openuserjs.org/).
