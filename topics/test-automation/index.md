**Test automation** or **automated testing** as compared to manual testing is a way to write test scenarios beforehand that can be repeatedly executed without involving a human element. This is often done by having a set of test data as input that can be compared to certain expectations. In agile software development approaches, this can be even based on user stories and/or acceptance critera.
