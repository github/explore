Kotlin is a statically typed programming language for modern multiplatform applications. 100% interoperable with Java and Android, it now supports JavaScript and native with LLVM (including iOS). It was developed by JetBrains in 2011, and designed to be a new language for the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that can compile quickly.
