Legend goes, that dotfiles were invented when `ls` used to skip files and directories starting with a `.` (dot). As a result, files that begin with such a character were not shown when listing using `ls` â€” i.e. it was a "hidden" file. Since dotfiles are ususually user-specific, a predestined place for them is the `$HOME` directory.

Commonly used files are for example: `.bashrc`, `.zshrc` or `.vimrc`.
