**Behavior-driven development** (**BDD**) is a test-first, agile testing practice. Without focusing on internal implementation, BDD tests are business-facing scenarios that attempt to describe the behavior of a story, feature, or capability from a userâ€™s perspective. Behaviour-driven development is a synthesis and refinement of practices stemming from test-driven development (TDD) and acceptance-test-driven development (ATDD).
