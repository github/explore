The **OpenAPI Specification** (**OAS**), previously known as the **Swagger Specification**, is a specification for a programming language-agnostic, machine-readable interface definition language for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing web services. OpenAPI documents describe API services and are represented in YAML or JSON formats.
