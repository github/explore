According to the UN Secretary General's Roadmap for Digital Cooperation, a Digital Public Good (DPG) is an open source software, open data, open AI systems, or open content collections that adhere to privacy and other applicable laws and best practices, do no harm, and help attain the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To be classified as a DPG, a digital solution must conform to the nine indicators of the [DPG Standard](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard). The Digital Public Goods Alliance maintains a [registry](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry) of digital solutions officially vetted and recognized as digital public goods.
