Universal standard for creating browser extensions.

Working through a W3C charter group, Mozilla has partnered with Microsoft and Opera to define a browser extension API that works across multiple browsers. 

There is currently a preliminary specification that matches what Google has implemented in Chrome so that extensions written to the specification could potentially work on Chrome, Edge, Opera and Firefox.
