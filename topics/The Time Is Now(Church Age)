Where is the church's promised Jerusalem?
It is the New Jerusalem that descends from heaven in Revelation's grand vision of the new heaven
And New Earth (Revelation 21----22)(Galatians 4;25--26)
Hereevil can never exist 'Waters of life" flow from the lamb's throne symbolizing God's intimate presence with his people
So amillennialists insist the church has displaced Israel.
