**Object-oriented programming** (**OOP**) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects fundamental to many programming languages, including [Java](https://github.com/topics/java) and [C++](https://github.com/topics/cpp). OOP can be devided in two sub types: class-based (or "classical") and prototype-based OOP (found in [JavaScript](https://github.com/topics/javascript), for example).

Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:
* OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
* OOP helps to keep the code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
* Logic can be abstracted, encapsulated, composed, inherited and decoupled
