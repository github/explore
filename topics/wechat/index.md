WeChat, also known as weixin (微信), is one of the most popular social media and messaging platforms in China, developed by Tencent. It combines instant messaging, voice and video calling, social networking, and a wide range of integrated services, including mobile payments (WeChat Pay), gaming, news, and mini-programs that allow users to access third-party applications without leaving the app. With over a billion active users, WeChat has become an essential part of daily life for many people in China, serving as a "super app" that integrates communication, entertainment, commerce, and more into a single platform. Its widespread adoption makes it a key tool for both personal and business interactions.
