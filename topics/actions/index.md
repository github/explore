GitHub Actions gives you the flexibility to build an automated software development lifecycle workflow. You can write individual tasks, called actions, and combine them to create a custom workflow. Workflows are custom automated processes that you can set up in your repository to build, test, package, release, or deploy any code project on GitHub.

â€œWith GitHub Actions you can build end-to-end continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) capabilities directly in your repository. GitHub Actions powers GitHub's built-in continuous integration service. For more information, see "[About continuous integration.](https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/about-continuous-integration)"
