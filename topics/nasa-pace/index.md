PACE [launched into Earth orbit][launch] on 2024-02-08 to extend and improve NASA's over 20-year record of global ocean biology (especially the tiny plants and algae that sustain marine food webs), aerosols (tiny particles suspended in the air), and clouds.

Two instruments fly on the satellite:
- The Ocean Color Instrument ([OCI]) is a spectrometer that measures light over portions of the electromagnetic spectrum.
  Sunlight interacting with substances present in open water, such as the green photosynthetic pigment found in phytoplankton and land plants, gives the ocean its dynamic and informative color.
- The multi-angle polarimeters [HARP2] and [SPEXone] are radiometers that measures how sunlight oscillates within a geometric plane&mdash;known as its polarization&mdash.
  Measuring polarization states of UV-to-shortwave light at various angles provides new information on the atmosphere and clouds, such as particle size and composition.
