Backdrop CMS is a simple, lightweight, and easy-to-use open source Content Management System (CMS) for building professional websites. A CMS is a database driven website that allows people to log in, and with permission, allows them to edit nearly any page. Backdrop can be used to create almost any type of website. Use Backdrop CMS for everything from a single-administrator's personal blog site, to a complex, multi-role, business e-commerce platform. Backdrop is the perfect fit for comprehensive businesses, non-profit, educational, government or corporate websites. Backdrop CMS is a fork of Drupal. Backdrop is Drupal 7 -- modernized. Backdrop's founders and early contributors saw the huge changes coming to Drupal 8, and met the need to maintain and improve this wonderful software that has a proven track-record of success. By providing an easy upgrade from Drupal 7, Backdrop will be the most affordable next step for sites running on Drupal 7 today.
