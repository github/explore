**Cucumber** is a software tool that supports behavior-driven development. Central to the Cucumber BDD approach is its ordinary language parser Gherkin. As such, Cucumber allows the execution of feature documentation written in business-facing text. It runs automated acceptance tests written in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style.
