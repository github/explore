Hanami is a full-stack Ruby web framework that is built for people. It consists of modular libraries and standalone components that work well together or can be used independently. Hanami focuses on simplicity, less DSLs, minimal conventions, more objects, zero monkey-patching, and the separation of concerns between Model, View, and Controller layers.
