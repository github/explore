Vibe-learning is an AI-assisted educational approach where learners leverage large language models and AI tools to create personalized, intuitive learning experiences. Inspired by the "vibe-coding" concept popularized by Andrej Karpathy, vibe-learning focuses on using AI to understand, contextualize, and enhance the learning process through natural language interactions rather than traditional structured educational methods.

Projects in this category typically include AI-enhanced personal knowledge management systems, context-aware learning platforms, LLM-powered educational assistants, and adaptive educational tools that maintain learning context across sessions.
