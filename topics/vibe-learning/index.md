Vibe-learning is an AI-assisted educational approach where learners leverage large language models and AI tools to create personalized, intuitive learning experiences. Inspired by the "vibe-coding" concept popularized by Andrej Karpathy, vibe-learning focuses on using AI to understand, contextualize, and enhance the learning process through natural language interactions rather than traditional structured educational methods.

Projects in this category typically include tools that maintain personal learning context, custom AI tutors, knowledge management systems enhanced with AI, and educational platforms that adapt to individual learning styles and preferences.
