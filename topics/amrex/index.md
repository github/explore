AMReX is a software framework for building massively parallel, block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) applications. It supports complex geometries, multilevel solvers, and particle methods. Parallelism is achieved via MPI across nodes and on-node parallelism using OpenMP for CPUs and CUDA/HIP/SYCL for GPUs. AMReX powers high-performance simulations in fields such as astrophysics, combustion, cosmology, and accelerator modeling.
