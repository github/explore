**Exploit** refers to a piece of code or technique that takes advantage of a security vulnerability in a system, application, or network to cause unintended behavior. Exploits can be used by attackers to gain unauthorized access, escalate privileges, execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service. This topic covers the various types of exploits, such as zero-day exploits, remote code execution, and privilege escalation. It also explores the lifecycle of an exploit, from discovery and development to deployment and mitigation, and highlights the importance of vulnerability management and patching in preventing exploits.
