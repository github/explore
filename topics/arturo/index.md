Arturo was designed with the intent of having a language that is flexible, easy to use even by beginners, yet powerful, easily portable, and with a solid batteries-included library. Its syntax shares many common elements with that of Rebol and is, thus, equally suitable for Domain-Specific Language (DSL) design as well.
