Supabase is an Open-Source Firebase Alternative.

It's been in development since April 2015 and is currently in production at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com). It's built on top of [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [GoTrue](https://github.com/netlify/gotrue), [Kong](https://github.com/Kong/kong), and [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/).
