Compilers are software that translate higher-level (more human readable) programming languages to lower-level languages (e.g. machine code). The processor executes machine code, which indicates when binary high and low signals are required in the arithmetic logic unit of the processor. Examples of compiled languages include BASIC, Fortran, C++, C, and Java.
