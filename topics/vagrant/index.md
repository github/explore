Vagrant is a software product for building and maintaining portable virtual software development environments, e.g. for VirtualBox, Hyper-V, Docker, VMware, and AWS. The core idea behind it lies in the fact that the environment maintenance of virtualizations becomes increasingly difficult in a large software development project.
