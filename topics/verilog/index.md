Verilog is a widely-used hardware description language (HDL) that enables designers to model, simulate, and synthesize digital circuits. It provides a text-based format for specifying the structure and behavior of electronic systems, making it easier to design complex hardware components such as microprocessors, memory, and communication devices.
