**CSS Frameworks** offer one or multiple stylesheets from basic styling to generic components to some extent, including but not limited to
* Reboot (aka "Preflight")
* Layout (often times "Grid")
* Forms, Tables, etc.
* [Typography](https://github.com/topics/typography)
* [Responsiveness](https://github.com/topics/responsive) (often times including breakpoints and [viewport](https://github.com/topics/viewport))

They often have their own class notation and many use [preprocessors](https://github.com/topics/css-preprocessor) like [Sass](https://github.com/topics/sass), [Less](https://github.com/topics/less) or [Stylus](https://github.com/topics/stylus).
