Nowadays, developers strive to have as identical environments for production, staging and development as possible to rule out any infrastructure interferance. Therefore, instead of installing and maintaining packages manually, **infrastructure** is defined and managed **as code**. Container orchestration solutions and version control systems help keeping all environments in sync and changes transparent.
