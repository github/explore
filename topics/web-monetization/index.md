Web Monetization (WM) is a proposed API standard that allows websites to request a stream of very small payments (e.g. fractions of a cent) from a user.
The API's framework provides new revenue models for websites and web-based services and is an alternative to subscription services and advertising, all while preserving the user's privacy.
In exchange for payments from the user, websites can provide the user with a "premium" experience, such as allowing access to exclusive content, removing advertising, or even removing the need to log in to access content or services.
