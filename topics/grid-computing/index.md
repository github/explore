Grid computing is a form of distributed computing that uses a network of computers to perform complex tasks. Grid computing is a form of parallel computing. The term grid computing was first used in 1997 by Carl Kesselman to describe the computing resources that were available at the San Diego Supercomputer Center. The term was popularized by the 2002 book Grid Computing: Making the Global Infrastructure a Reality by Kesselman and Tony Hey.
