A maze is a type of puzzle involving a collection of paths, usually where a player has to find a route from start to finish.

A huge variety of algorithms exist for [generating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm) and [solving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pathfinding) mazes. These are not only fun to implement, but also are a good way to familiarise yourself with programming techniques, algorithms, and languages.
