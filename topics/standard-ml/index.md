Standard ML (SML; "Standard Meta Language") is a general-purpose, modular, functional programming language with compile-time type checking and type inference. It is popular among compiler writers and programming language researchers, as well as in the development of theorem provers.

SML is a modern dialect of [ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_(programming_language)), the programming language used in the [Logic for Computable Functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_for_Computable_Functions) theorem-proving project. It is distinctive among widely used languages in that it has [a formal specification](https://github.com/SMLFamily/The-Definition-of-Standard-ML-Revised).
