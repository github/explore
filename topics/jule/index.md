Jule is an effective programming language designed to build efficient, fast, reliable and safe software while maintaining simplicity.  It is a statically typed, compiled language with a syntax influenced by Go, Rust, and C++. Jule aims to provide high C and C++ interoperability. To achieve this, Jule compiles its code to C++ code and supports powerful backend compilers such as GCC and Clang.
