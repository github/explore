A transgender person is someone whose gender identity differs from that typically associated with the sex they were assigned at birth. The projects in this category provide resources about gender transition, including gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT), gender-affirming surgery (GAS), real life experience (RLE), and voice training.
