**Simulation** refers to the process of creating a virtual model of a real-world system to study its behavior and performance under various conditions. This topic covers the principles, methodologies, and applications of simulation in fields such as engineering, science, healthcare, and social sciences. Simulations can range from simple models to complex, interactive environments, allowing researchers and practitioners to test hypotheses, train individuals, and predict outcomes without the risks or costs associated with real-world experiments. The topic also explores different types of simulation software and tools, as well as best practices for designing and validating simulations.
