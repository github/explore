Kryptokrona is a decentralized blockchain based on CryptoNote, which forms the basis for Monero, among others. CryptoNote is a so-called “application layer” protocol further developed by TurtleCoin that enables things like: private transactions, messages and arbitrary data storage, completely decentralized.

On April 2 2019, the platform was launched in part as a response to the Riksbank’s digital e-krona for the people’s right to create money and to safeguard the private economy without either commercial or store control.hat can compile quickly.
