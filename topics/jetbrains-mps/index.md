JetBrains MPS (Meta Programming System) is a language workbench developed by JetBrains. MPS is a tool to design domain-specific languages (DSL).
It uses projectional editing which allows users to overcome the limits of language parsers, and build DSL editors, such as ones with tables and diagrams.
It implements language-oriented programming. MPS is an environment for language definition, a language workbench, and integrated development environment (IDE) for such languages.
