CSG is short for Constructive Solid Geometry, a modeling technique that allows a modeler to create a complex surface or object by using [Boolean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type) [operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operator_(programming)), such as union and intersection, to combine [simpler objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_primitive).
