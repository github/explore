3D technology is used in a wide range of fields, including film, video games, architecture, engineering, and product design. It allows designers to create digital models of objects that can be manipulated and rendered in three dimensions. 3D modeling software is used to create and manipulate 3D models, and 3D animation software is used to create movement and effects within those models. 3D technology has also been adopted for use in 3D printing, where physical objects can be created from digital models.
