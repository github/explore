Bitcoin Cash (ticker symbol: BCH) is a decentralized peer-to-peer electronic cash system as outlined in the Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto that has fast, secure, reliable, and low fee transactions running on a permissionless and immutable blockchain network. Bitcoin Cash is the upgraded version of Bitcoin which carries the same genesis block that was started with Bitcoin in January 2009.
