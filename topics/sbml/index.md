SBML (the Systems Biology Markup Language) is an XML-based format for communicating and storing representations of biological processes. Its aim is to be a lingua franca for representing models in biology. SBML is suitable for models commonly found in research on a number of topics, including cell signaling pathways, metabolic pathways, biochemical reactions, gene regulation, and many others.
