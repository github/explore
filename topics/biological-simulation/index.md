Biological Simulation is the use of computational and mathematical models to simulate biological systems. The underlying complexity of biology necessitates the development of efficient algorithms, knowledge representation methods, visualization techniques, data formats, and computational tools to observe the emergent behaviors of biological systems. The broad scope and variety of time-scales and space-scales requires development of community-driven standards and common formats to enable interoperability and reproducibility of models.
