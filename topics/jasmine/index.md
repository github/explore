**Jasmine** is an open source behavior driven development testing framework testing for JavaScript. It does not rely on browsers, DOM, or any JavaScript framework. It aims to run on any JavaScript-enabled platform, to not intrude on the application nor the IDE, and to have easy-to-read syntax. Thus it's suited for websites, Node.js projects, or anywhere that JavaScript can run.
