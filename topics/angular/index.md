Released in 2016, **Angular** (also known as **Angular 2**) is a rewrite of [AngularJS](/topics/angularjs) and, unlike its predecessor, uses TypeScript instead of JavaScript. It focuses on good mobile development, modularity, and improved dependency injection. Angular is designed to comprehensively address a developer's web application workflow.
