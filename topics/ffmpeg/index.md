**FFmpeg** is a free and open source software project consisting of a suite of libraries and programs for handling video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams. At its core is the command-line `ffmpeg` tool itself, designed for processing of video and audio files. It is widely used for format transcoding, basic editing (trimming and concatenation), video scaling, video post-production effects and standards compliance (SMPTE, ITU).
