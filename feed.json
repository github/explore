It integrates very well with open source and commercial CI/CD solutions like Jenkins, CircleCI, Github Actions, and Azure Pipelines - just to name a few. It is also developer friendly and can easily be versioned with Git, and used with Docker and other container and virtualisation technologies to support building and maintaining of scalable (test) environments following the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">configuration as code</code> or <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">infrastructure as code</code> approach.

After processing the source document, TeX outputs a DVI file which is a device-independent binary file containing the positions of all characters in the document. The DVI file is then supposed to be processed by a device-specific program that combines the DVI file with the necessary fonts to create something that can be sent to a printer. Nowadays it is more common to use one of the extensions to TeX, e.g. pdfTeX which outputs a pdf file instead of a DVI file.</p>\n"
