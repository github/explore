The market for processors and microcontrollers is increasingly heated, and with the launch of the ISA (Instruction Set Achitecture) RISC-V, an open specification, it opens up a new opportunity for those who want to act either by researching or collaborating with new processors and microcontrollers.

Those who master the synthesis of Hardware with FPGA, can also propose more concretely new approaches for microcontrollers taking advantage of codes already written for the new architecture.

In this collection I try to present some renowned cores, and open the opportunity for other colleagues to collaborate with their suggestions.
