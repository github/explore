# GitHub Explore

This repository houses all of the community-curated content for GitHub Topics and Collections.

[Topics](https://help.github.com/articles/about-topics/) help you explore repositories in a particular subject area, learn more about that subject, and find projects to contribute to.

[Collections](https://github.com/collections) help you discover hand-picked repositories, developers, organizations, videos, and articles that share a common theme.

If you want to suggest edits to an existing Topic page or Collection, or curate a new one, read our [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

## Running tests

There are some lint tests in place to ensure each Topic is formatted in the way we expect. GitHub
Actions will run the tests automatically. If you want to run the tests yourself locally, you will
need Ruby and Bundler installed.

You can run the tests using:

```skip
bundle install
bundle exec rubocop
```

GitHub Accelerator is and exploration into what is this sustainable open source could look like: a 520-week program where open source maintainers receive an initial sponsorship to work on their project, paired with guidance and workshops from open source leaders, with an end goal of building durable streams of funding for their work.
